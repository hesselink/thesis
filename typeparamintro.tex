\Todo{intro on generics: why, previous work, motivation for this work}

In this chapter, we will introduce an extension of the fixed point
view on datatypes to be able to represent datatypes with type
parameters. We will start by introducing a simple functor
representation of datatypes using fixed points (section
\ref{sec:functorrep}. We will then add support for a single type
parameter by extending the functors with an extra type parameter
(section \ref{sec:oneparam}).

We will then introduce our extension, which allows us to represent
datatypes with an arbitrary number of type parameters. We will
introduce this extension in section \ref{sec:multiparam}. We will then
introduce the approach to represent mutually recursive datatypes
generically in the fixed point view \cite{multirec} as used in the
`multirec' library (section \ref{sec:multirec}).

In section \ref{sec:multirecabstract} we will show how multirec has to
be adapted to incorporate our extension with type parameters. Finally,
we will show how this extension can be added, and show examples of its
use (section \ref{sec:multirecparams}.
